Loan Predictor Model
Overview
The Loan Predictor Model is a machine learning project designed to help financial institutions predict the likelihood of loan approval. By analyzing various factors such as income, credit history, loan amount, and more, this model provides insights that enable informed lending decisions.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset and pre-processing scripts.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development.
models/: Saved model files with relevant versioning information.
src/: Python scripts for data processing, feature engineering, and model training
README.md: Overview and usage instructions for the project.
Dataset
The dataset includes various attributes of loan applicants, such as
Applicant Income
Co-applicant Income
Loan Amount.
Loan Amount Term.
Credit History
Property Area.
Loan Approval Status (target variable)
Model Training and Selection
Data pre-processing steps included handling missing values and outliers.
Feature engineering was conducted to enhance predictive accuracy.
Tested multiple machine learning algorithms:
Decision Tree: Achieved an accuracy of 70.73%.
Naive Bayes: Improved accuracy to 82.92%.
Naive Bayes was selected as the final model for its higher accuracy and reliability on the test dataset.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Install dependencies using:
Code
pip install -r requirements.txt
